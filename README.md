# Arduino + Processing Sonar Project 🌊

## Overview 🚀
This project is a simple yet fascinating sonar system using **Arduino Uno**, a **servo motor**, and **Processing** for visual representation. It scans the surroundings and provides a real-time visual map of objects within its range.

## Components 🔧
1. **Arduino Uno** 🟦
2. **Servo Motor** 🌀
3. **Ultrasonic Sensor** 📡 (e.g., HC-SR04)
4. Jumper Wires 🧵
5. Breadboard 📋
6. Laptop/PC with Processing software 💻

---

## Features ✨
- Scans the environment in a semi-circular range (0° to 180°).
- Real-time visualization using the **Processing** software.
- Adjustable scanning speed.

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Arduino Uno** controls the servo motor to rotate the ultrasonic sensor.
2. The ultrasonic sensor measures distances as it scans across the range.
3. Data is sent from Arduino to the **Processing** software over a serial connection.
4. **Processing** visualizes the data as a sonar-like display.
